### Libraries

 - Application entirely written in Java.
 - Asynchronous processing using [RXJava](https://reactivex.io/).
 - [JavaxEmail](https://javaee.github.io/javamail/) to send commerce notifications.
 - [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) for local data storage.
 - [Dagger](https://dagger.dev/) for dependecy injection.
 - Uses [JUnit4](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/junit-rules), [Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso), [Robolectric](http://robolectric.org/) among other libraries for unit & instrumented tests.

## Notes
This application consumes Firebase as a backend. Particulary Firestore, Auth and Firebase Storage. Hence for run EstiloCafe you need a Firebase account and import the google-services.json into the project. To do this follow [this](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup?hl=es) instructions

To make sending email service work, you need to setting an email account in EmailUtils class.

On the other hand, you have total freedom to extend the current functionalities and help me to solve any bug that you find :)
